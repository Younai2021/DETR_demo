## How to use this repository
1, You need to download the weights from this url: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detr/detr_demo-da2a99e9.pth  
2, Put it in the weights folder and rename the weight file as `detr_demo.pth`  
3, You can run the code directly through the `predict.py`  
Have fun with my demo code! ^_^
