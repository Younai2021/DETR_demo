This is my own implement fo DETR_demo 
Notice: the training process is not included in this implement 
### 1, You need to download the weights from this url:https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detr/detr_demo-da2a99e9.pth
### 2, Put it in the weights folder and rename the weight file as detr_demo.pth
### 3, You can run the code directly through the `predict.py`
Have fun with my demo code!
